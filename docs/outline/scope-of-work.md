The scope of work is divided into the following segments

### Design of a generator

As this is a new endeavor, we must commence by meticulously crafting the codebase for the generator. This will serve as the foundation for the project and set the tone for its future development.

### Development of a full-stack codebase

The codebase will utilize UI5/React for the frontend and NodeJS/Spring Boot for the backend, with the capability to deploy in `SAP BTP`.

### Boilerplate generator

The project will involve the creation of a `boilerplate generator` that provides a streamlined process for setting up a full-stack codebase and integrating necessary services.

### VSCode integration

With most users utilizing `Visual Studio Code (VSCode)` as their primary `Integrated Development Environment (IDE)`, the application can be made available as a VSCode plugin extension.

### Centralized codebase

The project will aim to have a centralized codebase by abstracting the underlying logic, allowing for an API or extension that targets the generator as either a `VSCode extension`, a `Graphical User Interface (UI)` application, or a `Command Line Interface (CLI)` plugin.

### Automating SAP BTP services

The project will involve automating the consumption of `SAP BTP services` for authentication and authorization within the application.
