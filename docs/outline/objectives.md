The objectives of my project are as follows:

- Provide a comprehensive and end-to-end solution for setting up a full-stack codebase
- Offer a streamlined process for setting up a full-stack codebase, including frontend, backend, and local setup and deployment descriptors
- Enable users to choose their preferred frontend and backend framework, as well as opt-in to use SAP BTP services for authentication and authorization
- Present the application as a `Command Line Interface (CLI)` extension, `Graphical User Interface (UI)` application, or `Visual Studio Code (VSCode) plugin` extension
- Unify the solution by having a centralized codebase that abstracts the underlying logic and can be targeted by an API or extension
- Reduce the time and effort required to initiate projects and `Proof-of-Concepts (PoCs)` by utilizing a tool
- Streamline the repetitive and labor-intensive process involved in setting up projects and deploying applications to `SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP)`
- Anticipate significant time savings in the setup of projects, which typically requires several days or even weeks to complete.
- To simplify the process of integrating common services utilized across SAP products.
