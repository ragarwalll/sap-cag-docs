## Getting Started

We offer the ability to `scaffold` your application using the `command-line interface` (CLI). This provides an alternative method for quickly generating the app's structure and code.

By utilizing the `CLI`, you can execute specific commands to initiate the scaffolding process. This allows for greater flexibility and automation, making it ideal for integrating with build scripts or incorporating into your development workflows.

The CLI provides a set of commands and options that enable you to specify the desired app features, select templates, and configure various settings. This way, you can customize the scaffolding process according to your specific requirements.

Whether you prefer the convenience of a graphical user interface or the flexibility of the CLI, we offer multiple options to scaffold your app efficiently and effectively. Choose the method that best suits your needs and start building your application with ease.
